#for i in gene_regions +- 100kb
    #sample 100 causal snps
#create genotype for causal snps

#beta is normal
# specify h2 and error
# genetic and enverironmental variance
#y X*beta + error
#great a one line gene region file for SKAT
#Run SKAT for that specific gene region using the singe gene region file
# RUN rbam for the genotype without pruning
# save the scores for that gene into the list
